# 🎨 Project Documentation: Building a Set of Colored Markers with CSS 🖌️

Welcome to Part 3 of our journey! This is where the magic happens. We're diving into the vibrant world of colors with CSS, thanks to the course on freeCodeCamp. Get ready to experiment with different color formats and shades! 😊

## 🛠️ Technology Used
This project is a beautiful blend of **HTML** and **CSS**. HTML is our foundation, structuring the content of the webpage, while CSS is our artist, styling the webpage to perfection.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned
This project was a colorful adventure into the creation of a set of colored markers using HTML and CSS. We discovered how to:
- Use CSS gradients to create a mesmerizing color effect 🌈
- Add a touch of realism with the box-shadow property for a shadow effect 🎭
- Arrange our markers neatly side by side with the display: inline-block property 🖍️

## 🎨 What Was Created
We brought to life a webpage displaying a set of three colored markers (red, green, and blue). Each marker is a masterpiece, represented by a div with the class 'marker' and a color class (either red, green, or blue). Inside each marker div, there are two more divs representing the cap and sleeve of the marker.

## 💡 Ideas to Make It Better
### More Colors:
Our set currently has three colors. How about we add more colors to make the set of markers more complete? 🌈
### Interactivity:
Let's add some JavaScript to make the markers interactive. Imagine being able to click on a marker to select it, and then draw on a canvas with the selected color! 🎨
### Accessibility:
Let's ensure that our webpage is accessible to all users. This could include adding descriptive alt text for any images, ensuring sufficient color contrast, and adding ARIA attributes where necessary. 🌐

## 📸 Visuals
Here are some screenshots of the webpage:
